## Why create a blog?
Creating a blog can serve a variety of purposes. It can be a journal for you to share your thoughts longform. It can allow you to share your knowledge of topics and help others who are still learning. It can be a tool to build a presence online, to point to at a job interview. It can be anything that written word can be when available to well over a billion people, users of the Internet.

## Maintaining a blog sounds like a lot of work!
If you really want to publish a lot, then it can be. But you're under no deadlines, no restrictions, and no pressure. When you create a blog, you should have the intention to maintain it, meaning you will write posts relatively frequently and consistently. If you can't or don't want to commit to that, creating a blog is probably not the best idea until that changes.

### I don't know how to create a blog...
Then let's find out!

<!-- Post 2: Creating a blog on WordPress.com -->
## Creating a WordPress Blog with WordPress.com
We're going to create a blog on WordPress.com. WordPress.com is the officially-branded WordPress host, where anyone can set up a WordPress blog for **free**.

Setting up a blog on WordPress.com allows you to write and publish blog posts on the Internet, with a choice of any one of a large volume of "themes" (a compilation of visual stylings for your blog), an index of your posts, and shareable links to post to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and most other social media.

### WordPress.com
#### Creation
First, we're going to head to [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) in our web browser. Once there, we will see the WordPress.com homepage, with a big button that says "Create Website". Click the button, and you will be taken to a setup wizard on WordPress.com to create your new blog.

###### Jumpstart: Setup Wizard
Here's what you'll want to select to get your blog up, without needing to consider and choose an option for every configuration possibility in the wizard.

* **What would you like your homepage to look like?**: Option one, "A list of my latest posts"
* **Choose a theme.**: By default we're going to use Libre, but feel free to choose any other theme that suits your fancy. We will discuss changing the theme at a later point.
* **Let's find a domain**: Type in your name (full, first + last initial, last + first initial are all options), your company name, your Internet handle, or another word or phrase that will serve as your domain on WordPress.com. For example, `tierneycoren`, `tierneyc`, `corent`, `schweetbiz`, and `animegabros` all work. For this example, I'm using `creatingingandmaintainingablog`. Once you've chosen a name, type it in and select the **free** `yourname.wordpress.com` option.
* **Pick a plan that's right for you.**: Pick the "Free" plan.
* **Create an account.**: Type in your email and desired password. You will recieve an email from WordPress.com asking to confirm your account - open the email, and click the provided link to confirm your account.

#### Publication
**yoursite.wordpress.com**: When you've completed the setup wizard outlined above, you will be brought to a page that gives you several options of tasks you can do on your WordPress site. For our purposes, we're going to simply go to your blog - type in the address you chose in the "Let's find a domain" step (the `yourname.wordpress.com` one). In my case, I chose `creatingandmaintainingablog.wordpress.com`, so I'm heading there. From here on, I'll refer to your address on WordPress.com as "your blog".

On your blog, you'll see a message along the lines of "Nothing found". You haven't written any blog posts yet, so there's nothing to display. Let's get a bare-bones first post out right away so you can have at least some content on your site.

##### Opening the Editor
We've got your blog open right now - if you don't, go to the address of your blog in your browser. Once there, you should see a black bar at the top. If you don't, go to WordPress.com and sign in with the account you made in the setup wizard. Once you've signed into WordPress.com, visit your site again and you should see the black bar.

On the right-hand side of the black bar, there is an icon of a pencil with a plus. Click this, and it will open the post editor. Write a title (I chose `Hey there, World!`, a play on the classic programming `Hello, World!` phrase), and a simple body that states your intent to write on and maintain your blog. Be sure to tell people to check back for more, and watch your social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, and so on) for alerts of new content. Here's what I wrote:

```
I've just started this blog, and aim to start writing consistently on it. Keep an eye out for future posts here and on my social media accounts!
```
On the left-hand side of your screen there is a big blue **Publish** button. Click that, and your post is live! Click **View Post** in the green notification at the top of the page to see your post.
