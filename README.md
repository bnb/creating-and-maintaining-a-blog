# Creating and Maintaining a Blog
#### A course for the MidYork NYS Library System / Little Falls MidYork branch on creating and maintaining a blog for younger adults.

## What?
This is an MIT-licensed course created to be taught to younger adults (roughly ages 18-32) on the topic of creating a blog, including setup, content creation, and maintaining a steady stream of content.

The audience will learn how to set up a WordPress.com blog, with an alternative (non-lectured) DigitalOcean setup guide. When they've got a public blog on the Internet, they'll be shown how to pick a theme and find + open the post editor. They will learn how to structure a post, and how to use the WordPress post editor, including how to format text for headings, boldface and italics, and other typographic elements, and how to add images and videos to a post.
